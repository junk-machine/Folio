# Folio
**Portfolio tracking. Simplified.**

Get it from [Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.nahk.folio).

It was so hard to find a decent stock tracking app for Android, so I decided to create my own:

 * No ads
 * No account
 * No data collection

All positions are organized into groups. Positions with no lots display current price per share.

Most of the actions are based on gestures:
 - Swipe group left to add new positions
 - Press and hold, then drag to delete
 - Swipe down to refresh

Happy coding!
